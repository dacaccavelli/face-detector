# Machine Learning Face Detector

The goal of this project was to explore machine learning and haarcascades to automatically detect the faces and eyes of individuals facing the webcam. Originally used as an exposure of computer science to middle school and high school students.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo into your Python3 environment and run the "Face_Eye_Detector.py" file

### Prerequisites

You will need the following modules:

```
numpy
cv2
scipy.io
inception_v3 from keras.applications
random
```
## Usage

Once the program is running, it should automatically begin detecting both faces and eyes.
There is additional "fun" functionality to apply hats to the heads of the detected faces by pressing 'h'.

The program can be closed by pressing 'q'.
